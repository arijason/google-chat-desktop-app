## Why
This is a clone of the google-voice-desktop app, except I've replaced voice.google.com with chat.google.com.
This way I can run both voice.google.com and chat.google.com with 2 separate accounts and 2 separate notifications.

I've also changed the icon to the old Hangouts icon to differentiate between the two.

Unfortunately, I have no way to detect when new messages appear or when the page attempts to send a notification.
