## Why
This is a clone of the google-voice-desktop app, except I've replaced voice.google.com with chat.google.com.
This way I can run both voice.google.com and chat.google.com with 2 separate accounts and 2 separate notifications.

I've also changed the icon to the old Hangouts icon to differentiate between the two.

Unfortunately, I have no way to detect when new messages appear or when the page attempts to send a notification.

When new messages appear, the exact phrase "1 new message" appears in the page source.  Once you read the message, that goes away.
This could trigger the taskbar icon change if I could read that change in the source.
I cannot figure out how to read the source and search for that variable.

Project abandoned.  Without notifications, this is no different than the Chrome app.
